       "I chose this pain-point because while the demand for sustainable energy technologies is growing rapidly, one of the main barriers to widespread adoption—especially among homeowners and small businesses—is the significant initial investment in equipment like solar panels, batteries, and inverters, combined with the technical complexity of integrating these systems efficiently into existing electrical setups. This is important because these groups represent a large market segment that can drive extensive adoption if the financial and technical hurdles are lowered.  \n",
       "\n",
       "It is a good candidate for an agentic solution (e.g., an AI-based platform or intelligent advisory system) because such a solution can personalize financing options, optimize system design, predict energy generation and savings, and provide step-by-step guidance for installation and maintenance. This reduces friction, uncertainty, and risk for end users, accelerating their transition to clean energy and expanding the overall market."
